I have tried to find a perfect Macaroni and Cheese recipe and I think I finally found it. This is not only easy but super yummy.

**Notes**

I use Cheez-its because my family loves them but if you don't have them on hand, you can use regular butter crackers with melted butter for the top.

You can also omit the ham and peas if you prefer. I add them for extra nutrition.
