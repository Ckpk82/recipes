A Christmas morning tradition although my kids ask for this frequently. For substitution or an easier/faster way of prepping this, look at the notes section.

**Notes**

If fresh basil is unavailable, substitute 1 tsp dried basil.

For the dough...you can substitute for a pound of thawed frozen bread dough.
