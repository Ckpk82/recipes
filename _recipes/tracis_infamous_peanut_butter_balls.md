image:  peanut-butter-balls.jpg
tags: holiday, christmas, chocolate, peanut-butter

ingredients:
- 2 sticks butter
- 2 cups peanut butter
- 2 cups crushed graham crackers
- 3 1/2 cups powdered sugar
- 1/2 cup chopped walnuts
- 1/2 cup shredded coconut, sweetened
- 1 package chocolate candy coating

directions:
- Melt the butter and peanut butter together. Mix in the remaining ingredients.
- Form the mixture into 1 inch balls and refrigerate.
- Over a double broiler, melt the chocolate candy coating (or 2 cups of chocolate chips with 2 TBLS of crisco).
- Using a fork, dip the balls into the melted chocolate and then scrap the excess chocolate off the bottom of the fork.
- Place the peanut butter ball on parchment or wax paper.
- Store the peanut butter balls in the fridge or the freezer to preserve. They never last that long in my house but the freezer will hold them for a month or two.
