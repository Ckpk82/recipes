Serve warm with vanilla ice cream! Yum!

If you don't have fresh cherries...try substituting with 2 cans of cherry filling and top with the topping ingredients. I would check them after 25 mins though.

**Notes**

I use less sugar if using sweet cherries.

Sometimes I half the recipe and use an 8x8 pan...just make sure you only bake it for 20-25 minutes if you do this.
