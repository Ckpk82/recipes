tags: desserts

ingredients:
- 18 Chips Ahoy cookies, crushed (optional)
- 6 oz bittersweet chocolate, chopped (semi-sweet)
- 2 oz unsweetened chocolate, chopped
- 3/4 cup unsalted butter
- 1-1/2 cups sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla
- 4 eggs
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 cup flour
- 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 325 degrees
- (optional) Crush the Chips Ahoy cookies (crispy choc. chip cookies) and spread in the bottom of a greased 9x13" pan.
- In a metal bowl set over a pan (or double boiler) of barely simmering water melt the bittersweet chocolate and the unsweetened chocolate with the butter, stirring until the mixture is smooth, remove the bowl from the heat, and let the mixture cool until it is lukewarm.
- In a large bowl, add the sugar then pour in the melted chocolate and butter. Stir in the vanilla and add the eggs, 1 at a time, stirring well after each addition. Stir in the salt and the flour, stirring until the mixture is just combined, and stir in the chocolate chips.
- Pour the batter into a well-buttered and floured 13x9 inch baking pan, smooth the top.
- Bake the mixture in the middle the oven for 30 minutes, or until a tester comes out with crumbs adhering to it. Let the mixture cool completely in the pan on a rack.

These are so addicting! Wow! I crave them at least every weekend, no joke. If you like super rich brownies that have a fudgy consistency, these are for you!

**Notes**

If you are baking these in a dark metal pan, the cooking time will be less.

I put the crushed Chips Ahoy cookies as an added bonus on these cookies. Love it! If I don't have time to do it or I don't have the cookies on hand...the brownies are still awesome without them.
