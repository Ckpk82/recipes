title: "Traci's Cinnamon Rolls"
tags: breakfast, bread

ingredients:
- 4 Tbsp granulated sugar
- 5 cups Original Bisquick® mix
- 1 1/3 cup milk
- enough butter to spread generously
- FILLING
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 2 1/2 Tbsp ground cinnamon
- FROSTING
- 1 (4oz) package cream cheese, softened
- 1/4 cup butter, softened
- 1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/8 tsp salt

directions:
- Heat oven to 375°F. Grease bottom and sides of 13x9-inch pan. In small bowl, mix brown sugar and the cinnamon; set aside.
- In medium bowl, stir Bisquick mix, 1 1/3 cup milk and 4 tablespoons sugar until dough forms. If dough is too sticky, gradually mix in enough Bisquick mix (up to 1/4 cup) to make dough easy to handle. Turn dough onto surface well dusted with Bisquick mix; gently roll dough in Bisquick mix to coat. Shape into ball; knead 10 times.
- Roll dough into 15x9-inch rectangle; spread with butter. Sprinkle evenly with the cinnamon filling. Roll up tightly, beginning at 15-inch side. Seal well by pinching edge of dough into roll. Cut into 1 1/4-inch slices; place cut sides down in pan.
- Bake 23 to 25 minutes or until golden brown. Cool 5 minutes. Remove from pan.
- In medium bowl, mix frosting ingredients until smooth. Spread glaze over warm rolls.

These really are quick to the table! You can add nuts and/or raisins if you wish.

Also, it does seem like a lot of cinnamon that you are using...yes it is TABLESPOONS and not a typo ;-)
