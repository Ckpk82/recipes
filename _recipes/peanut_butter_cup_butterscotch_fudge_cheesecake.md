title: "Peanut Butter Cup Butterscotch Fudge Cheesecacke"
tags: desserts, cake

ingredients:
- 2/3 pkg Oreo's, crushed
- 1/3 cup melted butter
- 4 packages Cream Cheese
- 1 cup creamy peanut butter
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/3 cup Splenda
- 4 eggs
- 1 cup sour cream
- 1/2 cup whipping cream
- 1 TBLS vanilla
- 1/4 cup flour
- FILLING
- 15 bite sized Butterfingers, crushed
- 6 Peanut butter cups, crushed
- PEANUT BUTTER FROSTING
- 4 oz Cream Cheese
- 1/4-1/2 cup peanut butter
- 3 cup powdered sugar
- 2 Tbsp whipping cream
- 1/2 tsp vanilla

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch springform pan.
- In a medium bowl, mix Oreo crumbs with melted butter. Press onto bottom of springform pan.
- In a large bowl, mix cream cheese with sugar until smooth. Blend in peanut butter, cream, and then mix in the eggs one at a time, mixing just enough to incorporate. Mix in sour cream, vanilla and flour until smooth.
- Spread 2/3rds the Filling on the outer parts of the crust then pour the cheesecake batter over the outer edge of the crust. (leaving the remainder for sprinkling over the top of the cheesecake).
- Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour. Turn the oven off, and let cake cool in oven with the door closed for 5 to 6 hours; this prevents cracking. Chill in refrigerator until serving.
- After cooling the cheesecake, top with some extra crushed chocolate "filling", then drizzle with the butterscotch/caramel ice cream topping. Beat all of the peanut butter frosting together and pipe it all over the top in a decorated fashion.
